                If you would have told me that in January of 2021 I’d be starting my own cookie company I would not have believed you.  I consider myself somewhat of a crafty artist and I’ve spent a lot of my life learning how to do something and then moving on to the next thing.  I can get obsessive over the details and I’ve found more than anything I love working with my hands.  Everything in my life that I’ve truly loved involves using my hands.  Holding my kids, my husband's hand, eating tacos … to name a few.  One of my first jobs was working as a floral designer and I happily spent 8-10 hours a day in a cold little room wiring flowers and poking greenery into oasis.  I then fell in love with making coffee.  An espresso machine is akin to a piano and I learned to play it really well.  I dabbled in macrame, painting, lots of cooking, candle making etc.  I’ve always had the desire to create but I’ve always been afraid to share that creation with anyone else and stopped when it got close to me doing so.  I’ve been obsessed with cookie artists for years, I watched all the videos and read all the things.  I made sugar cookies for all of my daughter's birthdays or little events and I finally thought, I think I could do this too.  Well here we are, I’m finally doing it.

                I’m Sarah, owner of Cookie Daughters.  I am a Mom of 2 girls (hence Cookie Daughters), my daughters Bryn and Hudson inspire me to be a better person everyday.  I realized after having my first daughter Bryn that in order for her to truly love herself I had to first show her how much I love myself.  I strive everyday to show my daughters that strong women can be afraid, they can cry but they can also tell the world what they want and make it happen.  My husband Ian is likely the most supportive husband on the planet.  He washes the dishes before going to work in the morning and kisses me on the cheek when he walks by me.  There is a lot of love in my home and I am grateful for all of it.   I thank you for being here with us.  By being here and supporting Cookie Daughters you are also supporting my family.  I’d love to make you some cookies.
