                Hello!  If you’re looking to order custom cookies you’ve come to the right place.  Please fill out all the questions below with as much detail as possible.  The more the better!

            <h2>PRICING</h2>
            <p>
                Pricing for a custom sugar cookie set is reflective of the time spent baking, color mixing, designing, icing and packaging.  Many orders require the purchase of new cutters or tools to ensure your order is absolutely perfect.  Each cookie will come individually heat sealed for freshness and will be beautifully boxed for your event.  Our sugar cookies are flavored with vanilla and have a vanilla lemon icing offering a modern twist on the classic vanilla cookie we all love.  Orders should be placed a minimum of 2 weeks before your event, 4-6 weeks is preferred.
            </p>
