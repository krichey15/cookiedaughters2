If you would have told me that in January of 2021 I’d be starting my own cookie company, I would have called you crazy.  I consider myself somewhat of a crafty artist, and I’ve spent a lot of my life learning how to do something and then moving on to the next thing.  I can get obsessive over the details and I’ve found more than anything I love working with my hands.  Everything in my life that I’ve truly loved involves using my hands:  holding my kids, holding my husband's hand, and eating tacos  to name a few.  One of my first jobs was working as a floral designer and I happily spent 8-10 hours a day in a cold little room wiring flowers and poking greenery into oasis.  I’ve been obsessed with cookie artists for years, I watched all the videos and read all the things.  I made sugar cookies for my daughter's birthdays and little events and I finally thought, I think I could do this too.  Well here we are, I’m finally doing it.
