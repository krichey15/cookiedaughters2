I’m Sarah, owner of Cookie Daughters.  I am a Mom of 2 girls, Bryn and Hudson, and they inspire me to be a better person everyday.  I realized after having my first daughter Bryn that in order for her to truly love herself, I had to first show her how much I love myself.  I strive everyday to show my daughters that strong women can be afraid, they can cry but they can also tell the world what they want and make it happen.  My husband Ian is likely the most supportive husband on the planet.  He washes all my cookie dishes and distracts the kids as I work on this little cookie business.  There is a lot of love in my home and I am grateful for all of it.   I thank you for being here with us.  By being here and supporting Cookie Daughters you are also supporting my family.  I’d love to make you some cookies.
